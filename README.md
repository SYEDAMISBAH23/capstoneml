# Employee Salary Prediction 📊💼

This project is a Machine Learning Capstone that predicts employee salary based on various factors like satisfaction level, average monthly hours, experience, department, job title, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world employee attrition data
- Visualized key patterns using bar, pie, and line plots
- Built and evaluated multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Compared model performances using RMSE and MAE
- Analyzed feature importances to understand salary drivers
